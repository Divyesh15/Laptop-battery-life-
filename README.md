# Laptop-battery-life-
this project shows how the algorith inside power statistics works to show us the how long our battery last depending on charging time.
I got idea to make such prediction from ubuntu 18.04 powers statistics and you also compare my ploted graph with it. 
Dataset-I use the dataset which contains 100 samples showing charging time and battery last time. I consider that when the laptop is full charged the battery lasts 8 hours.I got this dataset from hackerrank.

for regression line i use statastical formula and for another approch i use sklearn inbuilt LinearRegerssion.
